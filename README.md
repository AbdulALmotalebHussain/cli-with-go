# cli-with-go

he code you provided is a Go program that defines a command-line interface (CLI) for a certain functionality. Here's a brief overview of what the code does:

The code is located in the cli package.
The main function is the entry point of the Go program.
It uses the flag package to define command-line flags and parse them.
The -h or --help flag is set to provide usage information.
The program accepts two types of input:
If the first argument is "list", it lists all files in the current directory.
If the first argument is empty, it greets the name specified by the -name flag.
Otherwise, it greets the first argument.
To use this CLI, you can run the program with different arguments. For example:

go run main.go list: This will list all files in the current directory.
go run main.go: This will greet the name specified by the -name flag (default is "World").
go run main.go Alice: This will greet "Alice".
Let me know if you have any specific questions about this code!
