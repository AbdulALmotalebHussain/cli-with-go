# cli-with-go

To provide you with a detailed `README.md` for your GitHub project, I'll use the information from your provided code snippet as a basis. This code snippet suggests a command-line interface (CLI) tool in Go that can list files in the current directory or greet the user by a given name. I'll craft a README that reflects these functionalities.

# Go CLI Greeting Tool

The Go CLI Greeting Tool is a straightforward command-line application built with Go. It demonstrates basic Go programming techniques, such as handling command-line arguments and flags, and simple directory operations. With this tool, you can list all files in your current directory or receive a personalized greeting.

## Features

- **List Directory Contents**: Easily list all files in the current working directory with a single command.
- **Personalized Greeting**: Use a simple flag to greet a specific user name, adding a personal touch to your CLI interactions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before running this tool, you'll need to have Go installed on your system. To install Go, follow the official guide here: [Installing Go](https://golang.org/doc/install).

### Installation

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/go-cli-greeting-tool.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd go-cli-greeting-tool
```

### Running the Tool

To use the tool, you have two options:

1. **List Files in Current Directory**

   To list all files in the current directory, simply run:

   ```bash
   go run . list
   ```

2. **Greet Someone by Name**

   To greet someone by name, use the `-name` flag followed by the name. For example:

   ```bash
   go run . -name="Jane"
   ```

   If you don't specify a name, the tool will greet "World" by default.
